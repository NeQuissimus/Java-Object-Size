Include the JAR file in your project.

Add an agent to your JVM arguments as follows:
-javaagent:/PATH/TO/JAR/ObjectSize.jar

Call ObjectSizeUtil.getObjectSize() on your object and the size will be returned in bytes.
Call ObjectSizeUtil.getDeepObjectSize() on your object and all referenced objects will be checked as well.
